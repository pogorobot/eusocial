      <p>A turn can be anything,</p>
      <p>from an epistolary novel to nearly endless tears.</p>
      <p>There are no rules between us</p>
      <p>We are on the same team</p>
      <p>We win by having a really good team that scores lots of points</p>
      <p>And since we decide how you get points,</p>
      <p>our odds of winning are whatever we decide.</p>

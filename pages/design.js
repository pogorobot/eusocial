      <p>Eusocial is meant to help you be a social creature.</p>
      <p>There are as many ways to be a social creature as there are creatures in societies.</p>
      <p>Where c is the total number of creatures, and s is the total number of societies,</p>
      <p>The ways to be a social creature may be represented as sc</p>
      <p>The ways to help a social creature be helpful may then be (sc)^2, social creatures squared</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, not all combinatorial effects are necessarily helpful.</p>
      <p>That is why one way to be a social creature that helps other creatures be social</p>
      <p>is to eliminate potential ways of being by rendering them anti-social.</p>
      <p>This is known as &quot;setting boundaries&quot;, and is often regarded as important.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, existing as a social creature is the most difficult thing it is possible to do.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, it means you&apos;re not alone.</p>

      <p>One way to participate in society is by issuing invitations</p>
      <p>Or perhaps we might think of them as giving quests, or making bids</p>
      <p>Regardless of semantics, a positive indication that specific gameplay modes are welcome</p>
      <p>goes a long way toward encouraging those gameplay modes to exist and be pursued</p>
      <p>For example: This website looks pretty bare-bones.</p>
      <p>What would you do to make it look nicer?</p>
      <p>Are there areas where it looks like I don&apos;t know what I&apos;m doing?</p>
      <p>(I don&apos;t)</p>
      <p>Our win condition is we both look extremely cool and smart</p>
      <p>With a whole bunch of sage advice and fun activities</p>
      <p>I can&apos;t get there alone.</p>
    </div>
